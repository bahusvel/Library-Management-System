So far the technologies we will be using are:
Hibernate ORM &amp; Search.

<i> Used for Relational Database Management,
DB Transaction,
Persistance mapping of data to objects. </i>

For the DBMS PostgreSQL seems like the best option by far, as it supports many data types
has a lot of features and is open source.
To get your version of PostrgreSQL running locally on your machine go here:

And download the latest version for your operating system.
Go through the installation process wizard, and configure a password for super user.
You will need to remember this password to later add another user that will be used to access
the database that you will create.

JAAS (Java Authentication and Authorization Service) Built into java.
<i> Used for Authenticating system users and authorities. </i>
