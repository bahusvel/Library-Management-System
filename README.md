So far the technologies we will be using are:
Hibernate ORM &amp; Search.

<i> Used for Relational Database Management,
DB Transaction,
Persistance mapping of data to objects. </i>

http://hibernate.org/orm/

http://hibernate.org/search/

Hibernate does need DBMS (Database Management System) for it to run on top of. 
For that we can choose one of the following:
<ul>
<li>SQLite -- Worked wonderfull on my system, stores data in files. </li>
<li>MYSQL -- I had some trouble with it, and configuration is a pain. </li>
<li>MS SQL SERVER -- Used in class but I haven't tried it all. </li>
</ul>

JAAS (Java Authentication and Authorization Service) Built into java.
<i> Used for Authenticating system users and authorities. </i>
